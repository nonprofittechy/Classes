# Case Study â€“ Massachusetts Defense for Eviction Tool

## Who is the client?
Anna works for the MBTA and lives in subsidized housing with her two children. She wasn't paid for 2 months after being suspended from her job at the MBTA. Even though she's working again now, she fell behind in the rent and her landlord is bringing her to court to evict her. If she loses this housing she won't be able to get back in to affordable housing for several years and she can't afford to pay market rent. She's lost heat for a few days twice in the last 4 years and this past fall, there was a major leak in the apartment above and there was no ceiling in her bathroom for 4 weeks.

Anna talks to someone at her church who mentions a social services agency, ABCD, may be able to help her pay the back rent. She meets with ABCD and they recommend she attends the weekly eviction clinic at GBLS the following Monday. There are 8 people at the clinic with her who all have slightly different types of eviction cases. An attorney helps tenants in the group and then one-on-one with individual advice. A second attorney pulls out one of the clinic attendees who can't write very well to meet with one-on-one. The day starts for Anna at 9 AM and the clinic ends at about 12:30. The attorney running the clinic helps Anna find a problem with the landlord's case that could get it dismissed. She is able to leave at 1:00 when the administrative assistant finishes photocopying, and she needs to deliver a copy of the paperwork to her landlord and the court.

On Friday, Anna gets assigned an attorney to help her in court.  She's able to get the case settled on terms she can handle and keep her housing.
